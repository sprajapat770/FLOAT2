# Float â€“ A Modular PIM & E-Commerce Framework

## Overview

Float is a **modular Product Information Management (PIM) system** designed for businesses to efficiently manage  **products, categories, customers, and orders** . It offers a **scalable, flexible, and extensible** solution where functionalities can be installed or removed based on user needs, ensuring minimal conflicts between modules.

## Key Features

* **Modular Architecture** â€“ Each core functionality (products, categories, orders) is a separate module.
* **Seamless Integration** â€“ Storefront can be installed separately based on business requirements.
* **Customizable Attributes** â€“ Provides only essential attributes; users can create custom attributes.
* **Admin & Storefront Separation** â€“ Admin panel handles data management; the storefront module is optional.
* **Scalability & Extensibility** â€“ Allows easy enhancements through additional modules.
* **SEO & Enhancements** â€“ Additional modules like `module-seo` integrate into products/categories.

## How It Works

1. **Core System** â€“ Provides the base framework, including the admin panel.
2. **Modules** â€“ Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, and other extensions are independent modules.
3. **Storefront (Optional)** â€“ Businesses can install a storefront module to display their products.
4. **Flexible UI** â€“ Storefront UI components are separately installable.
5. **Dynamic Installation** â€“ Modules can be installed, updated, or removed without affecting the core.
